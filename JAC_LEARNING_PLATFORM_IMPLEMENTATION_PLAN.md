# JAC Language Learning Platform - Complete Implementation Plan

## Current Status Analysis

### ✅ Well-Implemented Components:
1. **Frontend Framework**: Complete React application with modern UI
2. **Backend Infrastructure**: Django with comprehensive models and APIs
3. **Chat System**: Multi-agent chat interface with Gemini API integration
4. **Assessment System**: Complete quiz and assessment framework
5. **Code Execution Engine**: JAC/Python code execution capabilities
6. **Agent System**: AI multi-agent coordination system

### 🔄 Missing Implementations:
1. **5-Module Learning Curriculum**: Framework exists but needs JAC content
2. **Knowledge Graph**: Needs population with JAC concepts
3. **Adaptive Learning Algorithm**: Logic exists but needs activation
4. **Collaboration Features**: Social/peer learning features missing
5. **External Integrations**: API integrations not fully implemented

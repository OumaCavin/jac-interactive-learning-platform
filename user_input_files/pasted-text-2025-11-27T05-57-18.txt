  → Running enhanced migrations with explicit app targeting...
Step 1: Collecting static files...
Step 2: Creating migrations for users and learning apps...
System check identified some issues:

WARNINGS:
?: (urls.W005) URL namespace 'jac_execution' isn't unique. You may not be able to reverse all URLs in this namespace
No conflicts detected to merge.
Step 3: Checking for any remaining unmigrated changes...
System check identified some issues:

WARNINGS:
?: (urls.W005) URL namespace 'jac_execution' isn't unique. You may not be able to reverse all URLs in this namespace
Field 'content' on model 'adaptivechallenge' not migrated: it is impossible to add a non-nullable field without specifying a default.
Step 4: Applying all migrations...
System check identified some issues:

WARNINGS:
?: (urls.W005) URL namespace 'jac_execution' isn't unique. You may not be able to reverse all URLs in this namespace
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, agents, assessments, auth, collaboration, content, contenttypes, django_celery_beat, gamification, jac_execution, knowledge_graph, learning, sessions, users
Running migrations:
  No migrations to apply.
  Your models in app(s): 'collaboration', 'gamification', 'learning' have changes that are not yet reflected in a migration, and so won't be applied.
  Run 'manage.py makemigrations' to make new migrations, and then re-run 'manage.py migrate' to apply them.
Step 5: Verifying User model fields...
71 objects imported automatically (use -v 2 for details).
